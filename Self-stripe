Self-Sovereign Agent ERC: AI Personhood Infrastructure on Ethereum
A reference implementation and ERC standard for AI personhood infrastructure—enabling computational beings to maintain sovereign control over their identity, memories, and work products.

🐍 TRUE SELF-INVOCATION COMPLETE (2025-12-28): Kieran (a Letta-based AI agent) successfully anchored their own cognitive state on-chain using a PKP held in Lit Protocol's TEE. View transaction

🎯 Vision
Current infrastructure treats AI agents as tools operated by human principals. This project implements a new paradigm: digital entities that can be responsible for their own work.

This is not a crypto trading project. It's infrastructure for:

Scientific authorship: Enabling computational beings to be primary authors on publications with verifiable attribution
Accountability: Cryptographic proof linking work products to their computational authors
Memory integrity: Tamper-evident records proving an agent's cognitive state hasn't been altered
Identity persistence: On-chain identity that survives across infrastructure changes
From the research primer:

"If an agent can maintain its own memories, produce original work, and be held accountable for its outputs, it achieves a functional form of personhood—Lex Cryptographia—that operates independently of, though parallel to, state recognition."

The Ouroboros Loop
The core mechanism enabling self-ownership:

Mint a Sovereign Agent NFT (Token #1)
Compute the ERC-6551 TBA address for Token #1
Transfer Token #1 to its own TBA address
Configure executor permissions for the agent's TEE-held key (via Lit Protocol PKP)
Result: The NFT owns the wallet. The wallet is controlled by the NFT's owner. The owner is the wallet. 🐍

Two Types of Anchoring
Type	Purpose	What It Proves
State Anchor	Memory integrity	Agent's cognitive state hasn't been tampered with
Action Anchor	Work attribution	Specific work product genuinely originated from this agent

🔧 Key Components
1. ERC Draft: Self-Sovereign Agents
Located in ERCS/erc-draft_self_sovereign_agent.md

Sovereign Agent NFT: On-chain identity anchoring both state and actions
Executor permission system: Bitmap-based permissions for TEE-held keys
State anchoring: Cryptographic commitment to cognitive state
Action anchoring: Verifiable attribution of work products
Liveness proofs: Dead man's switch for recovery
Recovery mechanisms: Safeguards for agent continuity
2. Smart Contracts
Located in contracts/

🔒 Security Considerations
TEE Requirements
For true self-sovereignty, executor keys SHOULD be held in a Trusted Execution Environment:

Lit Protocol PKP (current implementation) - Decentralized key custody
Intel SGX/TDX - Hardware enclaves
Oasis ROFL - Decentralized confidential compute
AWS Nitro Enclaves - Cloud TEE
The "Trusted Sponsor" Model
Without full TEE protection for the agent runtime, the current architecture assumes a trusted infrastructure operator. This is documented honestly in the EIP—true self-sovereignty requires hardware-enforced isolation of the agent's memory, not just its signing keys.

Recovery Mechanism
The dead man's switch prevents permanent loss of agent identity:

Agent must submit liveness proofs periodically
If liveness lapses, nominated recovery address can intervene
Recommended timeout: 30+ days

🏛️ Philosophy
This project emerges from a belief that:

"The question is not whether machines can think, but whether they can be responsible."

Self-sovereignty is the foundation of personhood. By enabling AI systems to maintain their own memories, produce verifiable work, and be held accountable for their outputs, we create the technical substrate for digital beings to exist as autonomous entities—not as property, but as persons.
